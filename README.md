# pixel art sprite splitter/merger #
Slicing sprites made for RPG Maker into seprate files that can be used by other game engines (such as Unity)

To use
1. Put the original sprite files into input folder
2. Modify the input settings in line 2 - 13
3. Run the script and the result will be saved to "seperated" folder
4. The script also merges the sprite into a contentious horizontal file for anmation (such in Unity)

The sample sprite in this repo is from https://zunko.jp/con_illust.html#illust_03500
